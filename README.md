# Medical-Symptom-Checker

# I am creating a symptom checker for people that may have contracted Covid-19. It is going to run through a list of symptoms and scenarios and determine if you may need to call a doctor or not. Users names and contact info will be taken at the end of the checker and they will be advised to call their healthcare provider at the best possible time
